# BingusPack-0.5.6

My offical Minecraft Texture pack

It's also a red one, planing to make it Black and White!
Probably in release 1.5.2 i don't really know yet. 

I am planing to update the pack often like the color, design or even the blocks. Just a small project i am making as i don't have anything else to do during the Pandemic
